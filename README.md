# Grocery-Sales-Prediction
we are trying to forecasts product sales based on the items, stores, transaction and other dependent variables like holidays and oil prices.
In this project, we are trying to forecasts product sales based on the items, stores, transaction and other dependent variables like holidays and oil prices. 
This is a Kaggle Competition called "Corporaci√≥n Favorita Grocery Sales Forecasting" where the task is to predict stocking of products to better ensure grocery stores please customers by having just enough of the right products at the right time. For this particular problem, we have analyzed the data as a supervised learning problem. 
In order to forecasts the sales we have compared different regression models like Linear Regression, Decision Tree, ExtraTreeRegressor, Gradient Boosting, Random Forest and XgBoost. 
Further to optimize the results we have used multilayer perception (MLP: a class of feed forward artificial neural network) and LightGBM ( gradient boosting framework that uses tree based learning algorithms).
